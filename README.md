# Inarion_Nameplates
Nameplate addon for World of Warcraft Dragonflight

## Features
- Simple improvements to Blizzard default nameplates.
- Add colored nameplates for specific units.
- Create your own color groups. E.g.: "Mythic+ casters" and "Mythic+ important interrupts" etc., each with its own color you decide.
- Toggle simple nameplate text, showing only last (and often the only important) part of longer names. E.g.: "Monstrous Corpse Spider" -> "Spider" and "Shadowmoon Bone-Mender" -> "Bone-Mender". This will help reduce clutter in situations where many nameplates are rendered simultaneously.
